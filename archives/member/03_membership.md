We do have two membership levels which imply various levels of participation in the Association. Read the [FAQ](../04_faq.html) to know more about how to participate. Read the [bylaws](../05_bylaws.html) and send your membership request by fulfilling and sending [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uYhoEga_Lc-kUDobRpNP09L4lTHqya51ZlyZPlh31Eg/viewform).

Have a look [here](member_list.html) to have the current list of member.

## Fees

The General Assembly accepted a membership fees of **50 EUR.- per year per person.** The entire membership fee is due for a calendar year, there is no pro-rata temporis.

## Categories

There are two categories of individual affiliation with the OCA: Member, and Delegate Member.


### Member

The first category is called Member. Individuals in this category have the same level of rights to work on OCA activities as the Participant category, but with the important distinction that these individuals are member of the OCA, they pay their contributions. 
By being a member, an individual is "opting in" and publicly acknowledging their connection to the OCA. This membership process also provides the OCA with a known, countable membership base. For example, the Board or various Committees may, from time to time, wish to poll the all Members on some important issue.

### Delegate Member

The second category is Delegate Member. Individuals in this category have the same rights as the above Member category, but with two important differences. Firstly, individuals in this category are not self-selected, but rather must be voted into this category by the other Delegate Members. Secondly, individuals in this category have the right to vote in elections for other Delegate Members, and for Board Members of the Association.

*These two factors are intended to maintain the integrity of the Association election processes -- and by extension the integrity of the Association itself. We use the term "Delegate Member" to explicitly indicate that these members are responsible for upholding the "delegate" of the Association.*

*Without the Delegate Member category to serve as a basis for the Board election process, it would be technically possible for a group of self-interested Members to "hijack" the Board and hence the Association itself, turning it away from our basic goals and principles.*

*We emphasize that the only real difference between a Member and a Delegate Member is the right and responsibility to vote at the Association level. It is not our intent to make the Delegate Members out to be some "privileged" class. Furthermore, the only real difference between a Member and a Participant is the self-registration on the Association's website. All mailing lists, projects, committees, and other Association activities are uniformly open and available to all friends of the Association.*
