Dear community,


You've probably heard that OpenERP has now become <a href="https://www.odoo.com/">Odoo</a> ! You can find information about this move in <a href="https://www.odoo.com/blog/Odoo-Blog-1/post/Odoo-The-New-OpenERP-156">this blog post</a>.

More than this, the project is also moving from  <a href="https://launchpad.net/openobject/">Launchpad</a> to <a href="https://github.com/odoo">Github</a>. That means a new organization will be necessary for us all in order to continue to contribute efficiently together.

We'll have an OCA board meeting during the Community days in June. This will be the place for us to discuss a new way of organizing the community. More news as soon as possible.

Best regards,



JoÃ«l Grand-Guillaume for the OCA's team
