Dear OpenERP community,

We have all been working for years hand in hand with OpenERP, and great work has been achieved since. Eight months ago, Camptocamp was pushing the community further by suggesting a new organization on Launchpad (the development platform) to better work together.

This information was relayed on the following blog: <a href="https://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/new-community-organization-for-openerp/">https://www.camptocamp.com/actualite/new-community-organization-for-openerp/</a>. This new organization allowed to put in place lots of good practices used in other big Open Source projects such as: code and peer reviews, teams of people and projects organized by topic, and a real structure to manage and promote the meritocracy between us all. From there, other great contributors joined us. Today, [the community reviewer team](https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer) is composed of 11 partners, the most active and invested being: <a href="http://camptocamp.com">Camptocamp</a>, <a href="http://therp.nl/">Therp</a>, <a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/">Savoir Faire Linux</a>, <a href="http://vauxoo.com/">Vauxoo</a>, <a href="http://www.akretion.com/">Akretion</a>.

Today, the time has come to go even further. Initiated by <a href="http://camptocamp.com">Camptocamp</a>, in collaboration with <a href="http://therp.nl/">Therp</a>, <a href="http://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/">Savoir Faire Linux</a>, <a href="http://vauxoo.com/">Vauxoo</a> and <a href="http://www.akretion.com/">Akretion</a>, the worldwide "<a href="http://openerp-community-association.org/">OpenERP Community Association</a>" has now been created!


Camptocamp want to thanks other founding members for their supports in this initiative.
