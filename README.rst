OCA Documents
=============

This repository contains OCA documents and static pages.

Although you may create pull requests to propose changes, the changes to legal
documents (Bylaws, ECLA, ICLA) will become effective upon the vote of the OCA
Delegates during the next Annual General Assembly.

Based on the vote results, the effective version available on 
http://odoo-community.org will be updated accordingly.

Please also keep in mind that the OCA is registered in Switzerland and
must answer some obligations due to the nature of its entity type.
These obligations may prevent your changes from being accepted.
