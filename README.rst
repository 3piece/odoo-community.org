OCA Legal Documents
===================

This repository contains the sources of OCA Legal documents, namely:

* `the Bylaws of the Association`_
* `the Entity Contributor License Agreement`_
* `the Individual Contributor License Agreement`_

.. _`the Bylaws of the Association`: Bylaws.rst
.. _`the Entity Contributor License Agreement`: ECLA.rst
.. _`the Individual Contributor License Agreement`: ICLA.rst

Although you may create pull requests to propose changes, the changes
will become effective upon the vote of the OCA Delegates during
an Annual General Assembly.

Based on the vote results, the effective version available on 
http://odoo-community.org will be updated accordingly.

Please also keep in mind that the OCA is registered in Switzerland and
must answer some obligations due to the nature of its entity type.
These obligations may prevent your changes from being accepted.
